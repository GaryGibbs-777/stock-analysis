# VBA_Challange
The purpose of this is to help Steve out. Since he asked for help with seeing how some stocks that his parents are interested in are performing, and help them make a decision. The analysis here will run mulitple stocks and compare them to find out which ones are perfoming will and which ones are not. A macro I made will sort through the data and visually display which ones are good and which ones are bad.

# Analysis
The stock analysis macro I made compared the stocks from 2017 and 2018. As viewed below, 2018 has most of the stock in the red or very bad stock. Whereas in 2017, the stock was better.

# Results
After refactoring the code, it runs faster by running thorugh all of the data one time to gather the information needed. That being the total daily volume, yearly starting, and ending prices. This will show hoe successful the stocks have been in that particular year. Below is the code I refactored.

Some of the advantages of refactoring code is that you have something to work with and you don't have to made a program from scratch, but that is a double edge sword too. Since, it can be hard to figure out what someone else did in their code and to make since out of it.
